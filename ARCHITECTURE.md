# Architecture

This document describes the structure of this repository.

## Tools

This project used [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to generate the static webpage from markdown files. This process will be done automatically when you push to the master branch.

## Structures

The mdBook project is laid out as follow:

```
Root/
 - book.toml
 - src/
    - SUMMARY.md
    - <other markdown files>
 - build/
    - <build target of mdbook>
```

1. `SUMMARY.md`

This file described the sidebar on the left side of the page. The file takes a "list of hyperlinks" and generate the page in that structure, the links can be infinitely nested but you should probably keep it within 3 nesting level.

2. `book.toml`

This file described the build configuration of mdBook. There should be no need to modify this file further.

3. `src/...`

This directory contains all the markdown files that should be visible on the actual site. All markdown files here will be generated but only the files that are linked inside `SUMMARY.md` can be navigated through.

4. `build/...`

This directory contains all the files that will be visible on the actual site. This directory will be automatically generated by mdBook when the workflow run so you should not add any files into this directory.
